Torch is a micro-monitoring system that allows users to create their own custom hierarchy and set rules for each layer. It utilizes multiprocessing in the backend for efficient performance. Users can organize their monitoring structure as needed and define specific actions or conditions at each level.

In Torch Users make their own blackbox script and send the results to the Thorch's ap in order to create a report. and start building their own monitoring hierarchy.

Reports are holding the initial value for the whole monitoring path, nodes are what we use In order to build our monitoring hierarchy.
We can define rules for nodes also
